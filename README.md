# United-States-Census
Build a classification model based on the features that you select to predict if the income is above $50k or not.

## Prerequisites:
I would highly recommend that before the hack night you have some kind of toolchain and development environment already installed and ready. If you have no idea where to start with this, try a combination like:
- Python
* scikit-learn / sklearn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* matplotlib
* An environment to work in - something like Jupyter or Spyder
* For Linux people, your package manager should be able to handle all of this. If it somehow can't, see if you can at least install Python and pip and then use pip to install the above packages.

## Dataset:
The dataset is in the form of a csv file and the link to download is given below:
